# Minta & The Brook Trout website

Minta & The Brook Trout is a Portuguese band.
I designed and developed their website, initially using WordPress. 
However, after experiencing issues with the theme, I decided to rebuild it with Vite, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with animations powered by Motion.
This is a temporary situation till I create it with NextJS.
