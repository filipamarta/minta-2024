        <h2>STRETCH (2025)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>ECONOMY CLASS</h3>
            <p>
              Down from where I sit~Way below these dreamlike cruising heights
              ~Someone’s going home for the night~Someone’s out buying dinner~~I
              am reading a book about walking~I’d much rather be walking~I’d
              much rather be doing pretty much anything~~If I need my legs to be
              moving ~For my thoughts to start to make sense~Well then, in my
              defense~This is no place for thinking~~In a narrow blue seat
              ~Pressing my face against the plastic window pane~My head is for
              spinning~And my heart is for sinking ~~Miniature snacks~Wheeling
              along~The carpeted aisle~Miniature drinks~Could you fizz this
              fuzziness away~~Miniature snacks~Wheeling along~The carpeted
              aisle~Miniature drinks~Would you fizz this fuzziness away
            </p>

            <h3>CANTALOUPE</h3>
            <p>
              Wake up late and dive right into the water~Then spend a while
              drifting in and out of sleep~Without the urge to give everything a
              meaning~Never even know what time it is~~The smell of sunscreen
              and ripe cantaloupe~The kind of weather that softens the
              muscles~Hold on to this languorous feeling~Slowly breathe it
              in~~Delectable hours~Of so little motion~Emotional stillness~Just
              sunlight to worship~~You don’t even like cantaloupe ~But oh the
              days when cantaloupe’s in season~Remember this languorous
              feeling~Slowly breathe it in~~Delectable hours~Of so little
              motion~Emotional stillness~Just sunlight to worship~~Just sunlight
              to worship
            </p>

            <h3>HOPE AND FICTION</h3>
            <p>
              In a palace of my own delusion~That’s where I find some peace~No
              outstanding bills no haunt me~No unending tasks to taunt me~In a
              palace of my own delusion~~At the intersection of hope and
              fiction~Is where I make my home~There’re a yes waiting for every
              request~There’s no doubt digging a hole in my chest~At the
              intersection of hope and fiction~~Oh the lengths that I can go to
              ~Look at me now~Will I laugh at it later?~I executive produce the
              drama~I’ll executive produce the sequel too~~Oh the very fabric of
              my wishful thinking~Is colourful and strong~No reality ever seeps
              through the seams~It won’t make me question the worth of my
              schemes ~Oh the fabric of my wishful thinking~~Oh the lengths that
              I can go to ~Look at me now~Will I laugh at it later?~I executive
              produce the drama~I’ll executive produce the sequel too

            <p>
              An airplane a ferry boat~And on the other side~I would still be
              the same me~And I’m no fun to be around ~~Should we have one
              more ~Or should we cut our losses~Come tomorrow~Will we be by each
              other’s side ~~I wasn’t born to be wild ~You take a little getting
              used to ~I wasn’t born to be mild~~I wasn’t born to be wild ~You
              take a little getting used to ~I wasn’t born to be mild~~An
              airplane a ferry boat~And on the other side~There would still be
              you and me~And you’re no fun to be around ~~I wasn’t born to be
              wild ~You take a little getting used to ~I wasn’t born to be mild
              (you take a little getting used to)~~I wasn’t born to be wild ~You
              take a little getting used to ~I wasn’t born to be mild

            <p>
              I’m aware that I’m not~The best of my kind~However many
              miles~~Still I think I may be~Of value to you~Let me prove
              it&#39;s true~~Please make room for me~Please make room for
              me~Please~Make room for me~~Please make room for me~Please make
              room for me~Please~Make room for me~~I can cook~And I can’t stand
              the sight~Of an unmade bed~If we were to be wed~~You’d never have
              to shop for vegetables~You’d never have to fold your own
              clothes~You’d never need~A dictionary~~Please make room for
              me~Please make room for me~Please~Make room for me

            <p>
              Hardware conveying~Your closeted dreams~Relaying them along~The
              satellites~~Leading you on~Your closeted dreams~Curated over
              years~Relentless~~Deferring to greatness~Your closeted
              dreams~Waiting in the dark~Wound so tight~~They know just the door
              to escape through~Your closeted dreams~They’ll endeavour to
              find~Their way out

            <p>
              This little art has made me feel a little less inept~This little
              art has filled my time and given me a script~Were I to go without
              it what would fill my sit-down days?~~I’ve written dialogue~I’ve
              written lines of poetry~I’ve written words for comic books and for
              my friends’ fanzines~I’ve written pages on construction, liner
              notes, terms of service~~Misunderstandings~Some I will love, some
              i’ll find fun~They are par for the course~Most I will learn
              from~And all will add up to random information~All will end up as
              random information~~This little art has made me feel a little less
              inept~This little art has filled my time and given me a
              script~Were I to go without it what would fill my sit-down
              days?~What would fill my sit-down days?~What would fill my
              sit-down days?~~Misunderstandings~Some I will love, some i’ll find
              fun~They are par for the course~Most I will learn from~And all
              will add up to random information~I go out of my way~And all will
              add up to random information~All will end up as random information

              It’s a competition~Muscles on a mission~Muscles on a mission in
              the sand~~It’s a competition~Muscles on a mission~Muscles on a
              mission in the sand~In the sand ~~Young misters, young
              misses~Coded recognition~Forget all you learned~Here in the in
              sand~~You paid for admission~They paid for admission~Will you melt
              under this willing surround stare~Surround stare~Surround
              stare~~Ice cream for distraction~Smoking for attention~Forget all
              you learned~Here in the in sand~In the sand ~In the sand

            <h3>EASY</h3>
            <p>
              Pots and pans ~Bearing witness to my failed attempts ~At
              domesticity ~With someone other than you~~Cloths and cutlery
              ~Sometimes they seem to stare right back at me ~As I stumble
              through another ~Awkward night ~~Hope there’s still some hope for
              me ~I want to learn to ride the wave ~~Oh my friends ~Gentle and
              kind, wise and prescient ~Have been letting me down easy ~Now for
              weeks ~~I’ll re-task ~The effort I put into colouring the past
              ~Into searching for a future I want in~~Hope there’s still some
              hope for me ~I want to learn to ride the wave

            <h3>INTERNATIONAL LOSS ADJUSTING</h3>
            <p>
              From under a cloud of dust ~I swear I felt my soul reach out
              ~New-agey as it may sound ~I heard it whisper in a gravelly voice
              ~~You can’t cut a slice of honey ~I’d found out the hardest way
              before ~Still I’m here for more ~~It didn’t have to be the summer
              ~All those summer evenings gone to waste ~But it was the case
              ~~From under a cloud of dust ~I swear I felt my soul reach out
              ~New-agey as it may sound ~I heard it whisper in a gravelly voice
              ~Enough ~~International loss adjusting ~International just in time
              for the end ~That’s how I’ve been ~I’m not great at being angry
              ~Waiting for the other shoe to drop ~I’d rather not ~~From under a
              cloud of dust ~I swear I felt my soul reach out ~New-agey as it
              may sound ~I heard it whisper in a gravelly voice

            <h3>THE FAKE OUTDOORS</h3>
            <p>
              I heard a creepy rendition~Of a song I used to love ~I was on the
              edge of thinking of something deep ~But there was someone at the
              door ~~For a moment the man peddling real estate~Looked like a
              handsome astronaut ~Lately I have the the attention span ~Of a
              tiny anxious dog ~~I might ~Run wild ~~At the very mention of a
              party ~At an early summer afternoon ~At myself reflected in a
              pretty stranger’s eyes~For the littlest of whiles ~~I went back
              into the apartment ~Holding a glossy brochure ~Of a house with a
              kidney-shaped swimming pool ~Surrounded by the fake outdoors ~~So
              if I ever grow a fortune~ – by some accident I’m sure – ~We can
              all lounge in the lounging chairs ~And drink wine like
              connoisseurs ~~I might ~Run wild ~~At the very mention of a party
              ~At an early summer afternoon ~At myself reflected in a pretty
              stranger’s eyes ~For the littlest of whiles
            </p>

            <h3>HALFWAY TRUE</h3>
            <p>
              Who would have thought ~At thirty-six ~I’d find myself jealous of
              a cat ~Who’s sitting on your lap ~~I make excuses ~To write to you
              ~~I’m trying hard ~Not to fall ~Before I know it’s halfway true
              ~Halfway true ~~Halfway true~Halfway true ~~How can I tell ~At
              thirty-six ~If this is wishful thinking~Or a momentary lapse of
              clarity~~Keep it simple ~Isn’t that the golden rule?~~Don’t go
              catching any feelings ~Before you’re halfway through to sure ~It’s
              halfway true ~Halfway true ~Halfway true ~Halfway true~~If it’s
              only halfway true ~I’m happy to have gone there with you ~If it’s
              only halfway true ~Halfway to ~Somewhere new
            </p>

          <li>
            <h3>NEIGHBOURHOOD</h3>
            <p>
              I wonder baby ~Did we get the chance to ruin every street in the
              neighbourhood~Did we get the chance to ruin every part of the town
              we love ~Or do you want to go again ~Do you want to go again ~~I
              wonder baby ~Are you ever going to come by and pick up the rest of
              your stuff ~Do you think we had the chance to break other’s heart
              enough ~Or do you want to go again ~Do you really want to go
              again~~I wish you would ~Stay off my mind ~I wish you would ~Stay
              off my mind~~I wonder baby ~Do you miss me most in the afternoon
              ~Will I stop missing you any time soon ~Or is this something else
              I’m going to have to learn to live with ~~I heard it said baby
              ~There’s a time and a place for everything ~You shouldn’t mix up
              the end and the beginning ~For a lack of better words to describe
              the mess that we found ourselves in ~~I wish you would ~Stay off
              my mind ~(some days I feel comfort in the weirdest things) ~I wish
              you would ~Stay off my mind~(some days I almost feel like myself
              again) ~I wish you would ~Stay off my mind~(some days I’m almost
              one with the universe)

            <h3>CHEWING GUM</h3>
            <p>
              I got up past the third snooze again ~I had sworn this year would
              be different ~A blackbird was singing a straightforward song ~And
              I tried to harmonize with it ~~I suppose it’s just how it
              goes~After your thirtieth ~You want to believe you can be anyone
              ~But it’s pretty obvious ~~Out of the abyss ~And into the groove
              ~I do the same thing ~Again and again ~~Finally moving I go
              through my pockets ~For a stray piece of chewing gum ~Aspartame,
              glycerin, peppermint flavour ~Lanolin, sodium ~~My best ideas die
              quietly ~At the altar of laziness ~I suppose it’s just how it goes
              ~After your thirtieth ~~Out of the abyss ~And into the groove ~I
              do the same thing ~Again and again
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>HERE COMES YOUR BABY</h3>
            <p>
              Here comes your baby ~Now if only you were taller~Here comes your
              baby ~And the room becomes much smaller~~Here comes your baby ~And
              the night is raw and tender~All the sharpness is suspended ~What
              can you do but surrender? ~~Here comes your baby ~You’d made up
              your mind to go home ~Here comes your baby ~There’s a riot in your
              eardrums ~~Here comes your baby ~And the center starts to cave in
              ~There’s no point in trying to blend in ~There goes all that you
              believed in ~~Here comes your baby ~There goes all that you
              believed in

            <p>
              Under the vertical garden ~In the fluorescent light ~You came up
              with a plan ~Then you let it go ~~Look at the vertical garden ~The
              shiny artificial plants ~They will never die ~They will never grow
              ~~Go out of your way ~Or fake it through another day ~Everything
              is real ~Make your peace with whatever you feel ~~The unwilling
              coalition of characters crowding your thoughts ~Make too much
              noise ~And way too little sense ~~When you run out of excuses
              someday soon ~You might just linger~In the present tense ~~Go out
              of your way ~Or fake it through another day ~Everything is real
              ~Make your peace with whatever you feel ~~Make your peace with
              whatever you feel

            <h3>SO THIS HAS TO DO</h3>
            <p>
              I once thought I could get my head in the game ~I had to give up I
              was going insane ~It was a nasty blow but it&#39;s better to know
              ~I once thought I could get my head in the game ~~We used to go
              dancing shake worries away ~It set everything right until night
              became day ~And we all hurried home hoping soon to forget ~Almost
              seeing the sun rise until the sun set ~~Now maps make me nervous
              they fill me with dread ~How they seem to tease with the lives I
              won&#39;t have ~Passed on too many chances of playing the fool
              ~And I doubt there&#39;s a heaven so this has to do

              Soft-spoken men ~In touch with their feelings~Slowly spending
              their miles ~~Mild-mannered men ~You&#39;ve met them for dinner
              ~They dress up ever so perfectly ~~Playlists and podcasts
              ~Comfortable couches ~There&#39;s some out there made for each of
              us ~~But not other people~They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re
              doing ~They wont do, so you tell yourself ~~You&#39;ve been
              spending way too much time alone ~~Soft-spoken preachers ~Of life
              changing mantras ~Make their way right past your heart ~~As do
              throwers of tantrums ~Who speak from their livers ~And just make
              you even surer that ~~Playlists and podcasts ~Comfortable couches
              ~There&#39;s some out there made for each of us ~~But not other
              people~They don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing ~They wont do,
              so you tell yourself ~~You&#39;ve been spending way too much time
              alone

              Were I to have been a tiger~I suppose I could do nothing
              wrong~There&#39;d be no allergies to haunt me~And no words to
              weave into my songs~~My instincts could betray me~But I
              wouldn&#39;t moan about it~My instincts would betray me~But I’d
              never dare to blame them~~And all these hours I can
              taste~They&#39;re mine and mine alone to waste~All these hours I
              can taste~They&#39;re mine and mine alone to waste~~Were I to have
              been vacation~I would be no tropical resort~I&#39;d be a beat up
              little cottage~I would be a quirky mountain lodge~~You&#39;d be so
              glad to see me~Something to write home about~You&#39;d be so glad
              to meet me~But so much more relieved to leave me~~And all these
              hours I can taste~They&#39;re mine and mine alone to waste~All
              these hours I can taste~They&#39;re mine and mine alone to waste

            <h3>BANGLES</h3>
            <p>
              I didn’t want to leave the house~But I followed you~You left our
              table for the dance floor~I never knew~I sat there looking at the
              old barkeep~Such sad eyes~For no amount of beauty would he crack a
              smile~~You can bet I’d dance if I could do it~I would glide on
              by~Keep my distance from the wall~~You can bet I’d dance if I
              could do it~I would glide on by~I would sway and they would
              fall~~I’ve changed my mind a million times~All morning long~I
              picked through bracelets and bangles~They all felt wrong~Is this
              whole city hung over?~How the sidewalk sticks~To the rubber
              beneath my toes~~You can bet I’d dance if I could do it~I would
              glide on by~Keep my distance from the wall~~You can bet I’d dance
              if I could do it~I would glide on by~I would sway and they would
              fall

            <p>
              A bearded band~Playing sad songs~Plaid and denim, head to toe~~You
              slow dance~On bare feet~With someone you’re not sure you want to
              know~~Now the singer’s going on about how~Everyone’s suddenly
              really into food~~He tucks his hair~Behind his ear~You wonder what
              he looks like in the nude~~The band takes a break~Before the
              second set~You step outside to smoke a cigarette~~You shelter the
              flame~Inside your winter jacket~It’s not even eleven yet~~Now your
              mind jumps back to the early morning~Looking out the window, half
              asleep~~The neighbor’s cat~Coming home real proud~A sparrow
              trapped between his teeth

              Reading the cheerful taglines~On the places you can still afford
              to rent~You wonder where the money went~It was just there~~Scaling
              up the blurry pictures~Flashes bouncing off the windowpanes~Paint
              peeling off the wooden frames~Dust everywhere~~Crooked tiles on
              the bathroom walls~Funny little entrance halls~It gets to be~Too
              much to bear~~Could you ever call it home?~~All you wanted was~A
              country house in the city~Fruit trees, luscious and pretty~Needing
              no care~~A respectable assortment of linen~Some go-to menus for
              dinner~And quiet weekends~~Could you ever call it home?

              Walked by the place where I first came to be~And where my father
              was born thirty-four years before me~It was named~After the Holy
              Trinity~~Third generation heathen~Born among the tireless
              sisters~A late addition~To a very fragile sum~~And now that I’m
              barely younger~Than they were when they had me~I let myself stop
              and wonder~At the Holy Trinity~~I lost track of afternoons in
              books~We were never allowed any pets~Except for the turtles who
              died~In their sad little tank~~And they would argue in
              restaurants~Even after they finally called it quits~Their hard-won
              cool burning up~In a matter of seconds~~And now that I’m barely
              younger~Than they were when they had me~I let myself stop and
              wonder~At the Holy Trinity

              I’ve never read a single page of the bible~And sleep wants nothing
              to do with me~I wasn’t looking for a friend or a rival~But if
              you&#39;re going to force me to choose you know which one I’ll
              be~~You’ve got nothing on me~So back the hell down~You’ve got
              nothing on me~~You are a clever storyteller; I will give you
              that~Given the chance you’d make the world see red~Yet I’d much
              rather not engage in these antics~Don’t you get enough trouble
              from the voices in your head?~~You’ve got nothing on me~So back
              the hell down~Back the hell down~~I’ve seen the ink in your
              neck~I’ve seen the friends that you’ve made~I’ve seen you breaking
              all the rules~~I know the words that you preach~And the excuses
              you make~Bad workers always blame their tools~~You’ve got nothing
              on me~So back the hell down~You’ve got nothing on me

              aching~And the sun is shining down too bright~~Both feet in the
              sand~Chin up, baby~~Skin pulled tight and chimes in our ears~The
              air is burning~It’s not quite what we had in mind~The air is
              burning~~Our heads are hurting and our eyes are heavy~And the sun
              is shining down too bright~Our lips are dry and our limbs are
              aching~And the sun is shining down too bright~~Both feet in the

              Never had a favorite color~Never won a single fight~I still can’t

              should I could I’ll try I might~Yet there’s something I got
              right~~I’ve got you to come home to~~Mostly I stay out of
              trouble~On the right side of the tracks~I just kind of lost my
              nerve and~Didn’t work to win it back~~I should I could I’ll try I
              might~Yet there’s something I got right~~I’ve got you to come home

              No it doesn’t make me look like a million bucks~No, not even
              close, you see~~That is not my color, dear, and it never was~You
              should know that after thirty-seven years~~There are days when I
              regret the hour we met~But I know I’d be lost out on my own~I’m
              tired~Please take me home~~Sometimes when I wake up I feel so
              light and free~Then I turn and see you lying next to me~~Can’t
              remember when I last spent the night away~Come to think of it, I
              can’t think of the day~~There are days when I regret the hour we
              met~But I know I’d be lost out on my own~I’m tired~Please take me
              home

              I can’t handle the summer~How I long for the slippery

              of~~Take it slow~Learn to let it go~Take it slow~~I can’t handle
              the summer~I can’t handle the heat~I fall in love every two
              seconds~It’s kind of embarrassing~~And I ignore the nagging
              voice~Trying to give me good advice~Along the lines of~~Take it
              slow~Learn to let it go~Take it slow

              abroad~Why don’t you want to sleep with me?~~I’ve been getting to
              know~Your father and his wife~I’d been plotting my way~My way into
              your life~~I used to live on the fence~But now I just want to
              dance~Why don’t want to sway with me?~~My heart is solid gold~I
              always do what I&#39;m told~Why wouldn’t you want to carry
              me?~~I’ve been getting to know~Your father and his wife~~I’d win
              the award~I swear you’d never be bored~~You’re light blue
              eyed~That’s from your mother’s side~Now you won’t even look at
              me~~I’ve been getting to know~~I guess it hardly qualifies~As the
              end of the world

              nice~There&#39;s glory in anger~There&#39;s goodness in
              vice~~There&#39;s just no reason why we should behave~We did what
              we&#39; re told and yet nothing was saved~We got all we could out
              of playing it nice~There&#39;s glory in anger~There&#39;s goodness
              in vice~~Set me free from you and~I&#39;ll set you free from
              me~But first~Let&#39;s tear our home to pieces~Let&#39;s make the

            <p>
              Life is good by the ones you love~When the ones you love
              behave~Cause when they don&#39;t it makes you mad~But you breathe
              in deep and brave it~~The vilest thing about family~It&#39;s that
              they own your heart for life~They can make it hurt and make it
              bleed~And they don&#39;t even have to try~~Try and enjoy the
              scenery~And the lovely, tangy wine~Get your hopes down from where
              they&#39;re hung~And be sure to hold the line~~The vilest thing
              about family~It&#39;s that they own your heart for life~They can
              make it hurt and make it bleed~And they don&#39;t even have to try

            <h3>THE DEVIL WE KNOW</h3>
            <p>
              Can we skip right to the part when everything is okay~When the
              rocky path we trod is far enough away~When we can remember the
              good times and have a laugh~When it’s clear in both our minds we’d
              never take it back~~You’ll tell me that you like my new shirt~I’ll
              tell you that I love your new shoes~I’ll let you know it’s so good
              to see you~You’ll let it slip you found someone new~~Can’t we just
              agree that this is not the way to go~That we’ve had more than
              enough of the devil we know~It has grown so tall and it’s got a
              mind of its own~If we let it loose you know it’ll chew us to the
              bone~~You’ll tell me that you like my new shirt~I’ll tell you that
              I love your new shoes~I’ll let you know it’s so good to see
              you~You’ll let it slip you found someone new

            <h3>FROM THE GROUND</h3>
            <p>
              It comes up from the ground just to haunt you~It creeps up and no
              one else can see~And the harder you try just to look the other
              way~Well the harder it bites at your sanity~~All the anger you
              felt surging through you~All the pain that you thought was behind
              you~All the love you once felt, all the love that was gone~It
              comes up from the ground just to haunt you
            </p>

            <h3>THE RIGHT BOULEVARDS</h3>
            <p>
              I don’t know but I have been told~There are people you can look up
              in the right boulevards~In their dingy offices~They’ll take care
              of you~They’ll patch you up, they’ll keep you all from~Crying~~In
              their dingy offices~Cluttered with paper stacks~And artifacts to
              keep you all from~Crying
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>GOLD</h3>
            <p>
              If felt as good as you~I would take to wearing gold~If I knew the
              things you do~I wouldn&#39;t dread this getting old~~No it
              doesn&#39;t take a genius~To get where you&#39;re coming from~Oh
              this heart that i&#39;ve neglected~It could sing a different
              song~~Your eyes full of sullen wisdom~Full of sorrow for my
              failures~Your head full of blissful boredom~You&#39;ve given up on
              my troubles~~No it doesn&#39;t take a genius~To get where
              you&#39;re coming from~Oh this heart that i&#39;ve neglected~It
              could sing a different song
            </p>

            <h3>AT YOUR WILL</h3>
            <p>
              They think you&#39;re bad but you think they&#39;re
              worse~You&#39;ll bring them down with a single verse~And
              they&#39;ll never know what has hit them &#39;til~You take over
              the world and bend it at your will~~Easy to miss that you had a
              plan~But they&#39;ll curse themselves once they understand~Fodder
              for their jokes all those years and still~You take over the world
              and bend it at your will~~They can be relied on but they sure
              can&#39;t sing~Beaches in the summer mountains in the
              spring~Everyday&#39;s another small step up that hill~And you take
              over the world and bend it at your will

            <h3>LARGE AMOUNTS</h3>
            <p>
              Give it up for those who have the guts~To hurt who they love~When
              they really have to~~Those who have the guts to love
              themselves~Above all the rest~When they really must~~There isn’t
              much I wouldn’t do for you~But don’t ask me to~Stick around
              forever~~There isn’t much I wouldn’t do for you~So don’t ask me
              to~Stick around forever~~Large amounts~Of fun and songs~But you
              still go hungry~You can still go hungry

            <h3>TO DISAPPEAR</h3>
            <p>
              Intentions are hanging in the air~So are the feelings~But words
              can’t seem to find their way out of your mouth~We sit in
              silence~~And this is leading us nowhere~There’s no way to go from
              here~And although I’m trying hard~You still want to
              disappear~~It’s always seemed like a waste of time to talk~And now
              we seem to have forgotten how it’s done~As we stare at everything
              but each other~So very quietly~~And this is leading us
              nowhere~There’s no way to go from here~And although I’m trying
              hard~You still want to disappear

              to~I&#39;m not going to choke~To choke~~I won&#39;t forget your
              birthday~I won&#39;t drink your beer~I won&#39;t smoke inside~I
              won&#39;t throw away your pillow~~I don&#39;t want to~I&#39;m not

            <h3>WITHOUT IT</h3>
            <p>
              We have had some lovely times~Though we fight the weirdest
              fights~You went out to clear your head~Said you didn&#39;t
              understand~~That I might just be looking for some answers~That
              maybe I’m just trying to find some hope~Why did I never feel like
              I couldn&#39;t live without you~I why did I never feel like
              you&#39;re a part of me~~And it&#39;s hard if you have ever been
              in love~To live every day to go through your life without it~~When
              you left I was so sad~Thinking about what you said~Maybe
              you&#39;re not coming back~And that might not be that bad~~’Cause
              maybe I have had enough of this~Maybe I&#39;m ready for something
              else~I want to feel like I couldn&#39;t live without it~I want to
              feel like it&#39;s a part of me~~And it&#39;s hard if you have
              ever been in love~To live every day to go through your life
              without it

            <h3>IF SHE CAN’T</h3>
            <p>
              It&#39;s a story of misuse~She has nothing left to lose~~She
              can&#39;t love you so she&#39;s better off unloved~She can&#39;t
              touch you so she&#39;s better off untouched~She can&#39;t have you
              so it&#39;s best that she&#39;s alone~If she can&#39;t have
              you~~Seeing you she falls apart~Seeing you it breaks her
              heart~~There&#39;s no way she&#39;ll ever love like she loved
              then~Just no way she&#39;ll ever feel like that again~She&#39;s
              accepted that she&#39;ll never have no one~If she can&#39;t have
              you

            <p>
              I can’t speak like I always do~The words come out all funny~And
              I’m not sure what it is about you~But I almost call you honey~~And
              I feel like telling you~All the things you make me want to
              do~~Hope I know when to stop~~I went home alone that night~And I
              do not regret it~I’m still not sure what I will do~The next time I
              am close to you~~Will I feel like telling you~All the things you
              make me want to do?~~Will I know when to stop?

              I don’t want to scare you but it has begun~Few hours left before
              the morning sun~~It’s about to come~~There’s nothing wrong with
              wanting to go on~No one’s going to blame you if you choose to
              run~~It’s about to come
            </p>

            <h3>DREAM OF YOU</h3>

              I can’t only be in love with you~During my lonely hours~I can’t go
              without thinking of you~For days on end~~And then tremble when~I
              talk to you~Wonder what~You think of me~Be sure that I’m~In lust
              with you~~And dream of you~Dream of you

            <h3>SO THE DANCE</h3>
            <p>
              The rain began to fall~And so the dance began~I feel it in my
              bones~This isn’t meant to last~I feel it in my blood~This isn’t
              going to end~I feel it in my bones~This will be over soon~I feel
              it in my bones~This isn’t going to end

            <p>
              Took my guitar and I wrote for you~Don’t think I could do much
              better than this~You asked me for it and so here it is~(Oh, come
              on, please)~A song to celebrate our love~~Maybe you never would
              have had the guts~If I hadn’t been the one to move first~But I’m
              so happy that I took the plunge~Now we can celebrate our love

            <p>
              Came to know you one night at a bar~One beer, two beers, three
              beers~You’re telling me the story of your life~And I don’t really
              want to hear it~I have only just met you~~As the booze sinks
              in~The air becomes unbearable~As the booze sinks in~The air
              becomes unbearable~In here~~Came to hate you that night at the
              bar~Four beers, five beers, six beers~I can’t stand it anymore~So
              I left early that night and you stayed~Drinking your lonely
              glass~As I walked away~~Once the booze sunk in~The air became
              unbearable~Once the booze sunk in~The air became unbearable~In
              there

              Once I was scared for you~Now I am scared of you~Is it ever going
              to be okay?~~I’m all torn up inside~I’m thinking run and hide~I
              never thought it would end this way~~Millions of seconds right up
              to that moment of craziness~I do not think I’ll be able to give it
              all up just yet~~Out in the cold again~Wondering out loud again~I
              owe it to you that I am back here~~Called my friends for advice~Am
              I paying some price~Was it my fault that you disappeared~~Millions
              of seconds right up to that moment of craziness~I do not think
              I’ll be able to give it all up just yet

            <h3>SEARCH SKIN DEEP</h3>
            <p>
              Finally I understand~What it’s like not to hold your hand~Finally
              I know how it feels~~Heartbreak of mine won’t you leave me
              behind~Won’t you let me go on with my life?~~I will have to search
              skin deep~For the shallow life I seek~~Maybe it will take
              someone~Without a trace of innocence~Maybe it will just take a
              moment~~Heartbreak of mine won’t you leave me behind~Won’t you let
              me go on with my life?~~I will have to search skin deep~For the
              shallow life I seek

            <p>
              There are things that I don’t know~And I’m fine with it~Concepts I
              can’t even grasp~It’s okay~~But there are things that I can’t
              bare~Others I just do not dare to ask you~~Are you going to make
              me happy?~Are you going to make me angry?~Are you going to make me
              sorry?~~ There are things that I just don’t understand~Like what
              exactly were you after when you held my hand~~And there are things
              that I can’t bare~Others I just do not dare to ask you~~Are you
              going to make me happy?~Are you going to make me angry?~Are you
              going to make me sorry?
